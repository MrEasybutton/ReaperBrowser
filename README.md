## About

**Reaper Browser** is an Unofficial Web Browser inspired by Calliope Mori!
### âœ¨ Highlights

- ðŸ’¡ Calli-inspired Aesthetic themed after Death's apprentice herself!
- ðŸ’  Chillingly fast search results that pop up as quickly as Calli spits a verse!
- ðŸ¤– CallAIope, the AI Summariser that reaps the pure info from your search results!
  (NOTE: Please look to the dev instructions and use a token of your own for this feature. CallAIope will be disabled for the User Build currently.)

Reaper Browser v1.0 is a hobby browser created using Tauri and NextJS for lightweight and rapid performance, but it's not going to replace your normal browser just yet!

## Features

### ðŸ’¡ Theme
A strikingly bloodthirsty theme inspired by Calliope Mori, crafted with TailwindCSS. It's pretty cool.

### ðŸ’  Search functionality
Results scraped from the DuckDuckGo API, giving speedy results with every search. It's kinda scuffed for now but stay tuned as it improves.

### ðŸ¤– AI Summary
CallAIope is the AI summary widget that gathers data from your query and results to form a concise stanza of information.
It runs on Facebook's bart-large-cnn model which was trained on CNN news materials. It does show the occasional bug though.

## Installation

### User
ISSUE: idk why but i cant build this, i got the error:
```
failed to read asset at (...)/src-tauri/target\release\.cargo-lock, and
--> src\lib.rs:14:10
note: this error originates in the macro tauri::generate_context (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
```
If anyone knows what went wrong, please do tell me.


### Development
If you're looking to modify, fork or simply take a peek at Reaper Browser's code, download the source code and open the project in your IDE of choice (I'm using WebStorm).
You can then browse the code for Reaper Browser.

Remember to add your own HuggingFace token/API key if you're looking to modify CallAIope AI Summary.
